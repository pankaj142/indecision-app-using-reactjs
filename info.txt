Goal- To understand JSX basics
No React Components are used. Manual data binding is done.

live-server is used for seeing the html changes inside the browser.

Use commands- 

1) yarn install
2) start babel to watch changes in src/app.js file and convert them => babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch
3) Install live-server package globally => npm install live-server -g
4) live-server public (in another terminal window)

-babel
-webpack
-sass
-normalize.css (for resetting browser's default css style setting- that makes your webapp looks almost same(style) on all browsers)

webpack is configured for
- stage-2 transform class properties
- devtool- for debugging-to get the exact location of error in the respective file
- scss(sass) files
